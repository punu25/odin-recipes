    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This isn't much of a recipe, but rather a way of preparing your duck.
        It required that duck you eat is disoriented when you eat it.
        There' something about duck confusion which really comes through when it's cooked.
        Be sure to kill it from a distance, because if it knows it will be killed, it will be scared instead of 
        disoriented. That really kills the flabour.
    </p>
    <p>How would you disorient a duck? Many ways to go about it. I am sur each way will create its own unique flavour.
        I encourage you to experiment. I will not reveal my methods. These PETA people can be quite, well, bothered
        about my methods, at times.
