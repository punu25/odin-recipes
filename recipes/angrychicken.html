    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe is unlike most chicken recipes, and cannot be made unless the chicken you have captured is really angry.
        The more seething the chicken, the better.
    </p>
    <p>It must be killed as it is seething, it is ideal to be kill it from a distance.
        I prefer a bow. You may prefer a gun. Certain people I know prefer shurikens.
    </p>
    <p>How do you get a chicken to be seething, you may ask? There are various ways to go about it.
        I myself quite like taking the egg the chicken has just layed, and cracking it open in front of her.
        There's something about it that just really riles them up. You may find your own methods.
    </p>
    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <p>Cook whichever dish you want. I find that angry butter chicken is a great medley. </p>
