This repo is made with the intention of improving at HTML. I have begun my coding journey once again. This time I am going forth with clarity.

I made a fool of myself for 6-7 years. This thought of being a musician has been with me consistently and defined my identity since the middle-ish 2017. Since them I have been forcing myself to become a musician. It suppressed who I really was. I never wanted to be a musician. It all became a process for the end. The fame of being a great musician.

I lived my life until this musician craze more or less happily, and playing music was never a part of my life. It's hard for me to understand why it suddenly became like that for me. But what is even crazier is that it took me 7 years to understand this. 7 years! That is not a small number, and I experienced severe DP/DR symptoms. 

These symptoms sucked the joy out of my life. Actually it sucked the leftover joy, because a major portion I had sucked away myself.

My college life went in that state. The final year which I got to spend on campus post covid, was hazy too, despite some very important experiences happening. 

I stepped away from life. But now I'm stepping back in. I will learn programming and become self-sufficient. 

Odin Project is a step in that direction.

But after everything, do I regret the way things happened? If those things hadn't happened, they would not have brought me to JGU and then who knows if I had taken another gap year during covid. All that led me to being with Raahat, who I love very very much. 

So all in all, I suppose things worked out.
